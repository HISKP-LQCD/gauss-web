Abstact:
It is a long lasting dream in nuclear physics to study nuclei like,
for instance, carbon directly from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the
underlying fundamental theory of strong interactions. Such an endeavor
is very challenging both, methodically and numerically. Towards this
goal physicists from the European Twisted Mass Collaboration and in
particular the University of Bonn have investigated two- and
three-hadron systems using the approach of Lattice QCD.

Report:
It is a long lasting dream in nuclear physics to study nuclei like,
for instance, carbon directly from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the
underlying fundamental theory of strong interactions. Such a
theoretical investigation from first principles is difficult for
several reasons: first, QCD describes a strong interaction which
cannot be solved approximately. Therefore, lattice QCD as a
non-perturbative method is required, for which the space-time is
discretised with finite lattice spacing. Second, the degrees of
freedom in QCD are so-called quarks and gluons, while nuclei can be
described reasonably well as bound states of protons and
neutrons. Protons and neutrons consist of three quarks each. The
computational complexity in lattice QCD is proportional to the
factorial of the number of involved quarks. Thus, a nucleus with more
than five protons and neutrons, i.e. more than 15 quarks represents a
major challenge. This challenge requires the usage of most modern
supercomputer resources available for instance at the Jülich
Supercomputing Centre (JSC). Third, bound states like nuclei can be
studied in lattice QCD only indirectly. This indirect approach is named Lüscher
method and can be understood as follows: imaging two, for simplicity
fully equal particles in a box with finite edge length L. If the edge
length L is much larger than the typical interaction range of the two
particles one expects little interaction between the two
particles. Any measurement of the two particle system will, hence,
yield twice what one measures for a single particle. As soon as L
becomes close to the interaction range, i.e. the particles feel each
other, one expects small modifications compared to the non-interacting
case. And these modifications are directly related to the 
interaction properties of the two particles. For three particles the
principle is similar, but the investigation of the corresponding two
particle system is required as a prerequisite. Here the additional
challenge is to disentangle those small modifications from the
background. 

Scientists of the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn
together with collaborators from the Extended Twisted Mass
Collaboration (ETMC) have been able to investigate various two-meson,
meson-baryon and three-meson systems. In particular, pion-pion,
pion-kaon and kaon-kaon systems could be studied with focus also a
careful evaluation of the relevant uncertainties, leading also to a
number of important publications. As one of the highlights, the
resources available through the supercomputer centre in Jülich made it
possible to study two- and three-pion systems at physical pion mass
value (dubbed the physical point).

Since this was a longer running compute project, the JSC supercomputing
resources used for reaching this result are JUQUEEN, JURECA and
JUWELS, including also JUWELS booster. The scientists had to develop
highly optimised software to make optimal use of these precious
resources. The generated data can be used for other projects, too, and
is still being anlysed.

In the figure results for the isospin-2 pion scattering
length a<sub>0</sub> multiplied with the mass of the pion
M<sub>&pi;</sub> as a function of the mass of the pion divided by its
decay constant f<sub>&pi;</sub> obtained in 2015 with the latest
results obtained in 2021 are comparede. The latest results [1] (orange
triangles) make the long extrapolation to the physical point using
chiral perturbation theory (ChPT, dashed line) superfluous, which was
still mandatory in 2015 [2]. The 2021 result is also fully compatible
with experimental results.

This result represents on the one hand a significant technical
advancement as it proves the feasibility of the investigation of three
hadron systems at the physical point, therefore allowing for a direct
comparison with experimental results. On the other hand the result
further fosters our confidence in QCD as a powerful theory to describe
the strong interactions in nature.

obtained within this compute project. The dashed line respresent the 
extrapolation of the results from [2] using chiral perturbation theory.
